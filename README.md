# zmk config

This is the configuration of my piano keyboard. The keymap is based on dvorak.

## TODO

The following aspects still need clarification:

- create a branch which has the corresponding mappings for the keys when used on a layout dvorak and not the standard en_us (QWERTY) layout
  - create comparison with my samice keyboard which uses the configuration on a dvorak layout
- do I want mouse support?
- I should add support for the output selection behavior to switch between usb and ble outputs (i.e. use two different devices at the same time)
  - maybe the default behavior is good enough for me, that I do not actually need this in my keymap
